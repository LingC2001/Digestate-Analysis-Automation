# Digestate-Analysis-Automation
Development of an automated system for perfoming digestate analysis for anerobic tanks.

## Project Brief
In anaerobic digestion (AD), microorganisms are used to break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. The process helps to solve two major problems in the world today. Firstly, it helps to to treat the biodegradable waste and sewage sludge that are produced in ever increasing amounts each year. Secondly, AD may be used as a source of renewable energy.
However, foaming poses an operational problem in anaerobic digesters. 

Project Objectives:
- Conduct operational interfacing of an anaerobic digester sample tester experimentation kit.
- Design a commercial ready portable anaerobic digester sample tester.

## Description
An machine learning approach was taken. Sample tester contains cameras, servos, load cells and temperature sensors to perform full analysis of digestate.
